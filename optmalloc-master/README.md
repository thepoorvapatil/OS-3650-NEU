# optmalloc
**Thread-Safe High-Performance Allocator**

This project was our second challenge assignment in CS 3650 Computer Systems at Northeastern University. I worked alongside a partner for this project.

## Goals
Create a thread-safe high-performance memory allocator that could run the Collatz Conjecture faster than the GNU malloc.

## How to use optmalloc
1. Clone this repository locally
2. Include the `"optmalloc.h` header in your file

## How to run tests:
1. Clone this repository locally
2. Via command line, go to the repository
3. Type `make` and hit enter
4. Type `perl test.pl` and hit enter to run the tests
